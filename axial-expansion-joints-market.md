<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axial Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flange Type</li><li>Welding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial expansion joints are designed to absorb movements in piping systems caused by thermal expansion and contraction. There are two main types of axial expansion joints on the market: flange type and welding type. Flange type expansion joints are connected to the piping system using flanges, providing a flexible joint for movement. Welding type expansion joints are connected through welding, offering a more secure and permanent connection. Both types serve the same purpose of accommodating movement in piping systems to prevent damage and maintain the integrity of the system.</p></p>
