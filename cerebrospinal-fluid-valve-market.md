<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Valve market includes two main types: Fixed and Adjustable valves. Fixed valves are set at a specific pressure and cannot be altered once implanted, providing a constant flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Adjustable valves, on the other hand, allow healthcare professionals to adjust the pressure settings post-implantation, offering more flexibility in managing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid based on individual patient needs. Both types of valves play a crucial role in treating conditions such as hydrocephalus.</p></p>
