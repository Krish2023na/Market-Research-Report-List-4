<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated Carbon Filters</li><li>Ion-exchange Resin Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Activated carbon filters are a type of chemical filter that use activated carbon to remove impurities and contaminants from water or air. These filters work by adsorbing the impurities onto the carbon surface. Ion-exchange resin filters, on the other hand, work by exchanging ions in the water with ions attached to the resin, effectively removing contaminants. Both types of filters are commonly used in water purification systems and are effective at removing a wide range of impurities for cleaner and safer water or air.</p></p>
