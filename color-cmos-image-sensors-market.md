<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Global Shutter</li><li>Rolling Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color CMOS Image Sensors are available in two types: Global Shutter and Rolling Shutter. Global Shutter allows all pixels to be exposed at the same time, providing a sharp, distortion-free image of fast-moving objects. This type is ideal for applications requiring precise timing and accurate motion capture. Rolling Shutter, on the other hand, captures images by scanning each row of pixels sequentially, which can result in image distortions when capturing fast-moving objects. Both types of sensors have their own advantages and are used in various industries such as automotive, surveillance, and consumer electronics.</p></p>
