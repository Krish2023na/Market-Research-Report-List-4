<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eddy Current Separators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric Rotor Eddy Current Separators</li><li>Eccentric Rotor Eddy Current Separators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concentric Rotor Eddy Current Separators use a rotor with magnets arranged in a concentric pattern to create eddy currents in the material being separated. This type is effective for fine and small particles. Eccentric Rotor Eddy Current Separators, on the other hand, have magnets arranged in an off-center position on the rotor, allowing for larger capacities and higher throughput. Both types are commonly used in recycling and waste processing industries to separate non-ferrous metals from other materials.</p></p>
