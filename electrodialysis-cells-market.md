<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrodialysis Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Electrodialysis</li><li>Batch Electrodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrodialysis cells are used for separating ions from solutions by utilizing an electric field. In continuous electrodialysis, the process occurs continuously, allowing for a more efficient and steady separation of ions. On the other hand, batch electrodialysis operates in batches, making it suitable for smaller scale operations or when continuous operation is not necessary. Both types of electrodialysis cells have their own advantages and applications, with continuous electrodialysis being more suitable for large-scale and continuous separation processes.</p></p>
