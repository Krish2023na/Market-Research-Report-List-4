<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impedance Muffler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Expansion</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Impedance Muffler market includes two main types: Expansion and Resonance. Expansion type mufflers use multiple chambers to expand and slow down the exhaust gases, reducing noise through absorption. Resonance type mufflers use sound waves to cancel out noise by reflecting it back towards the source. Expansion mufflers are effective in reducing high-frequency noise, while resonance mufflers are better at reducing low-frequency noise. Both types are commonly used in industrial and automotive applications to control noise pollution.</p></p>
