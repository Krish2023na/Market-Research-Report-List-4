<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kick Scooter Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Tires</li><li>Pneumatic Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Kick scooter tires are available in two main types: solid tires and pneumatic tires. Solid tires are made from a dense rubber material and do not require inflating, making them low-maintenance and puncture-proof. They provide a smooth ride but may not offer as much shock absorption as pneumatic tires. Pneumatic tires, on the other hand, are filled with air and provide a more cushioned ride, making them ideal for rough or uneven terrain. They may require more maintenance, such as inflating and monitoring air pressure levels.</p></p>
