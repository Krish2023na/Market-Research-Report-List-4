<p><strong>The Lower Extremity Bone Fixation Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stainless-steel</li><li>Titanium</li><li>Bioabsorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lower extremity bone fixation screws are commonly used in orthopedic surgeries for stabilizing fractures and fusions. They are available in three main types: stainless-steel, titanium, and bioabsorbable. Stainless-steel screws are strong and durable, but may cause metal sensitivity in some patients. Titanium screws are lightweight, biocompatible, and offer good strength. Bioabsorbable screws gradually dissolve in the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove them. Each type has its own advantages and considerations based on the patient's needs and preferences.</p></p>
