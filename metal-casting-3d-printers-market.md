<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Casting 3D Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Laser Melting (SLM)</li><li>Electronic Beam Melting (EBM)</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective Laser Melting (SLM) in metal casting 3D printers involves using a high-powered laser to selectively melt and fuse metal powder particles together, layer by layer, to create a solid object. Electronic Beam Melting (EBM) is similar, but uses an electron beam instead of a laser to melt the metal powder. Other types of metal casting 3D printers may include binder jetting, material extrusion, and direct energy deposition, each with their own unique process of creating metal components through additive manufacturing techniques.</p></p>
