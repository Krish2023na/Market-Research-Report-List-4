<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Thermal Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary</li><li>Compact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers (RTOs) are air pollution control systems used in industrial processes to eliminate harmful emissions. There are two main types of RTOs in the market: Rotary RTOs and Compact RTOs. Rotary RTOs are larger and more suitable for high-volume applications, while Compact RTOs are smaller and more cost-effective for lower flow rates. Both types use thermal oxidation to break down volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) into water vapor and carbon dioxide, thus reducing environmental impact.</p></p>
