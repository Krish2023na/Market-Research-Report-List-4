<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retro-Reflective Photoelectric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Separate</li><li>Compact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retro-reflective photoelectric sensors come in two main types: separate and compact. Separate sensors consist of a transmitter and receiver that are placed across from each other with a reflector to detect objects passing between them. Compact sensors, on the other hand, combine the transmitter, receiver, and reflector in a single housing. Separate sensors offer greater flexibility in positioning and longer sensing distances, while compact sensors are more space-efficient and easier to install in tight spaces.</p></p>
