<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Laboratory Centrifuges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bench-top</li><li>Floor-standing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Veterinary laboratory centrifuges are available in two main types: bench-top and floor-standing. Bench-top centrifuges are compact and suitable for smaller labs or clinics, offering convenient use on a counter or table. They are generally less expensive and have lower capacity compared to floor-standing models. Floor-standing centrifuges are larger, more powerful, and can accommodate higher volumes of samples. They are typically used in larger veterinary facilities or research laboratories where high-speed and high-capacity centrifugation is required. Both types play a critical role in separating substances of different densities in veterinary medicine.</p></p>
