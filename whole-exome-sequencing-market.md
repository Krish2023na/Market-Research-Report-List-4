<p><h1>Whole Exome Sequencing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Whole Exome Sequencing Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Whole Exome Sequencing is a technique used in genetics research to analyze the protein-coding regions of an individual's genome. This method involves sequencing all the exons, which are the parts of the DNA that actually code for proteins, rather than sequencing the entire genome. This allows researchers to identify variations in genes that could be linked to certain diseases or conditions.</p><p>The Whole Exome Sequencing Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% during the forecast period. The market growth is being driven by the increasing demand for personalized medicine and the rising prevalence of genetic disorders. As more and more healthcare providers and researchers recognize the potential benefits of whole exome sequencing, the market is expected to continue expanding.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Whole Exome Sequencing Market is the use of this technique in cancer research. By analyzing the exons of cancer patients, researchers can identify specific gene mutations that could be targeted with personalized treatments. This approach holds great promise for improving outcomes for cancer patients and is driving further growth in the market.</p></p>
