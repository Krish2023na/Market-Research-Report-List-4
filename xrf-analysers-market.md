<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The XRF Analysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wavelength Dispersive (WDXRF)</li><li>Energy Dispersive (EDXRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>XRF Analysers are categorized into two types: Wavelength Dispersive XRF (WDXRF) and Energy Dispersive XRF (EDXRF). WDXRF instruments use crystal diffraction to separate and detect X-ray wavelengths, offering high accuracy and resolution but at a higher cost. On the other hand, EDXRF instruments utilize a detector to measure the energy of X-ray photons, providing a more cost-effective solution suitable for routine analysis. Both types of XRF analysers are widely used in industries such as mining, pharmaceuticals, and environmental monitoring for elemental analysis.</p></p>
